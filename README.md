Predictive Analytics Project for Crypto Coin Using NLP for Sentiment Analysis

### Crypto Coin that will be used

Choosing a crpto coin for this project entailed that the crypto has to be relativily stable and have a detailed history. Ofcourse, Bitcoin and ETH would be the obvious choice, but I decided to with Solana, because it has grown alot in the recent years. Ofcourse, same could be set for others, but what set SOL apart is the overall disconnectivity with Bitcoin and ETH. It has on occassion behaved opposite to ETH and Bitcoin, which is very promising. This is important because major crypto prices are often medelled by government laws and big corporations, this would make sentiment analysis later less accurate.
